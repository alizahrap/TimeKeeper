# Time Keeper
A minimalist terminal-based scheduling app.

## Installation
1. Fork this repository and cd into it.
2. Run 'python interactive.py'
3. The app should start right away.

You can and should write a bash alias to shorten this process (I use 'tk').

## Usage
The instructions are easy to follow, and the app is controlled entirely through the keyboard.
